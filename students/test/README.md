SVA IxD Slow Code, Fall 2014
============================

Overview
--------

In Slow Code, students write homegrown code and share it with their local classmates. Like the Slow Food Movement, the class advocates the benefits of using locally grown produce (code) and skillfully judging the origins of globally produced food (code-libraries/snippets). Students are given time to learn the craft, exploring how it relates to their unique skillsets and interests. At minimum, they learn how to use code as a means of increasing their toolset, as well as read and understand other peopleâ€™s code. At best, the craft will grow its roots into their perception of systems, processes, and ultimately enrich their creative processes.
